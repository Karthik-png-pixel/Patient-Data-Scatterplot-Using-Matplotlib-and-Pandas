# Patient-Data-Scatterplot-Using-Matplotlib-and-Pandas
Imported patient datasets from a csv file consisting of both male and female weights and height. Created new data frames using pandas to gain statistical insights into the data such as minimum and median and constructed a detailed scatterplot using matplotlib packages to gauge the correlation between height and weight, as well as highlighting the specific patient datapoint I made for reference.
