Project Overview: 
Tools used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
Imported patient public health datasets consisting of both male and female weights and height. Created new data frames using pandas to gain statistical insights into the data such as minimum and median heights and weights amidst a detailed scatterplot using matplotlib packages. Additionally a generally positive correlation was assessed between the 2 variables based on all the points available.
